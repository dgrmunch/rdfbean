        RDFBean is an Object/RDF persistence framework for Java. It provides a
        simple, yet highly expressive annotation based mapping language and a
        type-safe query language based on Querydsl. The combination of a
        generic data persistence model (RDF) and a type-safe access layer for
        entities and queries makes it an ideal tool for rapid application
        development.
